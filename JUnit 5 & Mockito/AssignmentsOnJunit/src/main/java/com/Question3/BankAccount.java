//3) Write a BankAccount class with method withdraw which accepts amount to be withdrawn
//from the account (amount to be deducted from the balance of the account). In case there
//are insufficient funds a InsufficientFundsExpcetion should be raised. After defining the
//method perform Junit testing to check whether the InsufficientFundsException is raised
//when you try to withdraw amount that is over and above the account balance.
//bankAccount.withdraw(20,000); should raise the InsufficientFundsException if the
//balance in the account is less than 20,000.
